Per the request of some PC members, we are providing some Recommendations & Notes on the Applied Research Judging / Review Process.

- A reminder that papers have already been published by a conference or journal 


- The larger goal of the competition is to bridge the gap between academic research and industry development by rewarding papers that have a large practical impact and to make successful students and papers easily accessible to the industry. 


- Your assessment should focus on the practical relevance of the paper to applied cyber security. The Review Form captures your assessment by asking you to evaluate the importance of the problem, the novelty of the solution presented, the practical impact of the paper, with an overall accept or reject evaluation. 


- Written remarks to the Committee are optional. These can be useful in the instance of a tie. 


- Comments to the Paper Authors are also optional. Please keep in mind that the work is already published, so comments on potential future avenues of exploration, or relevancy to the concept of practical impact are probably the best form of feedback vs. advice on how to improve the paper.
